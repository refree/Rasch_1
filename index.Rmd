## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r data_input}
hls2 <- read.csv("data_pre.csv", header = T)
str(hls2)
hls2 <- hls2[2:45]

hls2[hls2 =="2"]<- NA


```

## 모델 피팅
```{r model fit, include=FALSE}

mod2 <- tam(hls2)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
summary(mod2)

plot(mod2, type = "items")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
